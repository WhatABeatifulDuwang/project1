                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Ody Chen and I'm 24 years old and a student at Techniek College Rotterdam. My hobbies are gaming and anime, which you can see of the image and video to the right.
                    On the image you can see a boss in Dark Souls 3, which is one of my favorite games.
                    The video is a meme in the One Piece(an really popular anime) community, which I like a lot.
                </p>
                <h2>My education</h2>
                <p>
                    Currently I'm a first-year Software Developer at Techniek College Rotterdam. Previously I have done a few years on HBO-Informatica major Software Development on Avans University of Applied Sciences in 's-Hertogenbosch.
                    I also own a Havo certificate. The programming languages I have learnt are the markup language HTML, CSS, Java, C# with ASP.Net, PHP Laravel and a bit of Python.
                    Through my education I also know how to utilise the Waterfall method and the Agile Scrum method. I also know how to make models and how to manage databases.
                </p>
                <h2>My work experience</h2>
                <p>
                    I don't have any work experience in the field of ICT. Although, I do have a lot of communication skills to compensate with. I have worked years in the catering industry. For example in a local snack bar or at a sushi restaurant in the city.
                    Working in the catering industry has helped me to gain perseverance and social skills. Although I know I still don't have the required work experience in ICT, I do know that my other work experience and my education will help me to fit right in.
